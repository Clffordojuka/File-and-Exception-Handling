# File Read & Write Program

## Overview
This Python program demonstrates efficient file handling. It reads the content of a user-specified file, modifies the content (e.g., converting text to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file. The program includes error handling to manage cases where the input file doesn't exist or cannot be accessed.

## Features
- Reads content from a file specified by the user.
- Modifies the content (default: converts text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content to a new file specified by the user.
- Includes comprehensive error handling for common file-related issues.

## How It Works
### File Reading
1. The program prompts the user to enter the name of an input file.
2. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised and handled gracefully, displaying an appropriate message.

### Content Modification
- The content of the file is passed to the `modify_content` function.
- By default, the function converts the content to uppercase. This function can be customized to perform other modifications, such as replacing words or applying transformations.

### File Writing
1. The program prompts the user for the name of an output file.
2. The modified content is written to the specified file.
3. Errors, such as permission issues, are handled explicitly.

### Error Handling
- **`FileNotFoundError`**: Displays an error message if the input file does not exist.
- **`PermissionError`**: Displays an error message if the program lacks permission to read or write a file.
- **Other Exceptions**: Any unexpected errors are caught and displayed.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone or download the script.
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to specify the input and output filenames.

### Example Interaction
#### Input File: `example.txt`
```
Hello, Python!
File handling is fun.
```

#### Program Execution:
```
Enter the name of the file to read: example.txt
Enter the name of the file to write the modified content: modified_example.txt
Modified content written to modified_example.txt successfully!
```

#### Output File: `modified_example.txt`
```
HELLO, PYTHON!
FILE HANDLING IS FUN.
```

#### Example with Error Handling:
```
Enter the name of the file to read: missing_file.txt
Error: The file 'missing_file.txt' does not exist.
```

## Customization
- Modify the `modify_content` function to apply your desired transformation to the file content. For example:
  - Replace words:
    ```python
    return content.replace("old_word", "new_word")
    ```
  - Convert to lowercase:
    ```python
    return content.lower()
    ```

## Code
```python
def modify_content(content):
    """
    Modify the content of the file.
    Example: Convert text to uppercase.
    """
    return content.upper()  # You can customize this function for other modifications.

def read_and_write_files():
    try:
        # Ask the user for the input filename
        input_file = input("Enter the name of the file to read: ")
        
        # Open and read the input file
        with open(input_file, "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        # Modify the content
        modified_content = modify_content(content)
        
        # Ask for the output filename
        output_file = input("Enter the name of the file to write the modified content: ")
        
        # Write the modified content to the new file
        with open(output_file, "w") as file:
            file.write(modified_content)
        
        print(f"Modified content written to {output_file} successfully!")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{input_file}' does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: Permission denied to read/write the file.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    read_and_write_files()
```
